# Homestead Twin – High-Level Design

This document describes the the Unreal Engine 5.x "Digital Homestead Twin" used to visualize and interact with the Fluxology Homestead in 3D/VR.

## Purpose

- Spatially accurate digital twin of the homestead (land, containers, infrastructure).
- Training and planning environment for operations (power, IT, deterrence, workflows).
- Visual front-end for 3D-scanned geometry and, later, live telemetry.

Further detailed design will be iteratively added here.
