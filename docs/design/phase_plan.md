# Homestead Phase Plan (P0–P5)

This file tracks which physical assets and systems appear in each homestead build-out phase.

- Phase 0: Minimal containers and basic power/data.
- Phase 1: Workshop container, initial rack population.
- Phase 2: Tiny-home container, basic orchard layout.
- Phase 3: Greenhouse, expanded orchard, ponds/swales.
- Phase 4: Extended perimeter and deterrence systems.
- Phase 5: Full build-out including auxiliary infrastructure.

Details per phase will be fleshed out over time.
